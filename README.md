# google-form-line-noti-image
# Description
This project is designed to facilitate the process of submitting before and after images of work through a Google Form. The images are saved in Google Drive and notifications, along with the images, are sent to the manager via the Line application. To ensure successful transmission through the Line API, images larger than 2.5 MB are automatically reduced using the "ImgApp" Google Script library.
